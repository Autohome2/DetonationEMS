- DetonationEMS is currently undergoing a rebranding initiative and will soon be known as OpenLogicEFI. We want to emphasize that this change is limited to our name; the ownership and our unwavering commitment to providing excellent open-source products remain unchanged. As we transition, links may redirect between both DetonationEMS.com and OpenLogicEFI.com websites. Thank you for your continued support during this exciting phase of our journey.
